# Gray Ambulance ML Project

A machine learning–based system designed to analyze ambulance operations, detect anomalies, and compute operational risk scores for improved emergency response insights.

**Developed by:** Hament Kumar
**Project Type:** Gray Mobility Internship Assignment
**Note:** This project is **fully designed, implemented, and completed manually by Hament Kumar**.

---

## Project Overview

This system simulates ambulance incident data, performs data quality checks, engineers meaningful features, detects anomalies using ML models, and calculates composite operational risk scores.
It also provides a **Flask REST API** for real-time predictions and analytics.

---

## Key Modules

* **Data Generation:** Creates realistic synthetic ambulance incident data.
* **Artifact Detection:** Identifies missing values, outliers, and temporal or geographic anomalies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Builds time-based, performance, and environmental features.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Uses ML models such as Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
* **Risk Scoring:** Computes composite risk levels (Low → Critical) from operational factors.
* **REST API:** Provides endpoints for anomaly prediction, risk scoring, and analytics.
